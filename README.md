# Project1
Mitchel, Dylan, Ruchita &amp; Katja's first project

# Function
Our website allows the user to input any movie to find the information of that movie, and the soundtrack.

#How It Works
When a movie is entered, the website will pull specific objects of information from the OMDB API, create a container, and append the image of the movie and snippets such as director, year, and plot. At the same time, a button will appear above the title of the movie that will take the user-input and use Spotify's API to produce a new page on Spotify's web player with the soundtrack of that movie.
